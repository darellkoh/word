# GrabGab
A nautical-themed, fast-paced animated word game inspired by Boggle. Find as many words as you can within a 6x6 square grid of letters before your time runs out, and block your opponents' boards with a dancing crab man when you submit a word that has 6 characters or longer!

Final capstone project for Fullstack Academy's Software Engineering Immersive (July-October 2016).
